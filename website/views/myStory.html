Out of my graduating class, only one person pursued software development
while the rest of us went into law, engineering, medicine and business. 
Albeit being an avid gamer in my teenage years, programming was something that was foreign to me. 
I am always comfortable using computers, but the idea of building software and applications was never something I thought I was capable of.</p><p class="myStory">   Fast forward a few years, my family and I moved to Canada. I was accepted into University of British Columbia and graduated with Honours in Accounting.
For the past seven years, I pursued a career as a CPA accountant and eventually worked as a management consultant. 
Throughout my career, I have worked with organizations across all sectors, from local non-profits and local tech startups to
biopharmaceuticals and multinational mining corporations. I have worked with teams across Canada and on multinational projects in Mexico and Argentina.</p><h2 class="myStory">A crossroad appeared</h2><p class="myStory"> A few years back, I was reflecting on my career and felt like I needed a new challenge. I wanted a career that allows me to create things and to solve problems.
During one of our food adventures, one of my closest friends who is a software developer posed the question "What about software development?"
I thought to myself "I do not think I am good enough." and rubbed it off.</p><p class="myStory">A few months later during my 2017 trip to South America, on a train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, a gentlemen sitting beside me was programming on his laptop and I decided to
strike a conversation with him. Three hours later, my interest in software development was kindled. A few days later while in Medina, Colombia, I 
started exploring schools that offer computer science as a second degree and eventually applied for Oregon State University the week I landed back in Vancouver. 
Within a week, I received my acceptance letter and never looked back since.
