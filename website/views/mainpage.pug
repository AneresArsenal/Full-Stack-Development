      | As the Swedes say it best, hej hej! First of all, thank you for visiting my page. 
      | I created this website (see: work-in-progress) mainly for two reasons. 
      | First, as a personal diary to reflect on my journey of pursuing my passion in software development/data analyics. 
      | Second, to share some exciting things I am doing (including building this website!)
