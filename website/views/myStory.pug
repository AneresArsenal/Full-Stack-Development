      | "Still round the corner there may wait,
      br
      | A new road or a secret gate,
      br
      | And though I oft have passed them by,
      br
      | A day will come at last when I,
      br
      | Shall take the hidden paths that run,
      br
      | West of the Moon, East of the Sun." - J.R.R. Tolkien

    h2.main Once upon a time
    p.myStory  
      | Growing up in a small town in Southeast Asia, pursuing software development was never tabled as an option. 
      | Out of my graduating class, only one person pursued software development
      | while the rest of us went into law, engineering, medicine and business. 
      | Albeit being an avid gamer in my teenage years, programming was something that was foreign to me. 
      | I am always comfortable using computers, but the idea of building software and applications was never something I thought I was capable of.
    p.myStory  
      |   Fast forward a few years, my family and I moved to Canada. I was accepted into University of British Columbia and graduated with Honours in Accounting.
      | For the past seven years, I pursued a career as a CPA accountant and eventually worked as a management consultant. 
      | Throughout my career, I have worked with organizations across all sectors, from local non-profits and local tech startups to
      | biopharmaceuticals and multinational mining corporations. I have worked with teams across Canada and on multinational projects in Mexico and Argentina.


    h2.main A crossroad appeared
    p.myStory  
      | A few years back, I was reflecting on my career and felt like I needed a new challenge. I wanted a career that allows me to create things and to solve problems.
      | During one of our food adventures, one of my closest friends who is a software developer posed the question "What about software development?"
      | I thought to myself "I do not think I am good enough." and rubbed it off.
    p.myStory
      | A few months later during my 2017 trip to South America, on a train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, a gentlemen sitting beside me was programming on his laptop and I decided to
      | strike a conversation with him. Three hours later, my interest in software development kindled. A few days later while in Medina, Colombia, I 
      | started exploring schools that offer computer science as a second degree and eventually applied for Oregon State University the week I landed back in Vancouver. 
      | Within a week, I received my acceptance letter and never looked back since. [To be continued...]
