      | Growing up in a small town in Southeast Asia, pursuing software development was never tabled as an option. 
      | Out of my graduating class, only one indivddual pursued software development
      | while the rest of us went into law, engineering, medicine and business. 
      | Albeit being an avid gamer in my teenage years, programming was something that was foreign to me. 
      | I have always been comfortable using computers, but the idea of building software and applications was never something I thought I was capable of.

      | Fast forward a few years, my family and I moved to Canada. I was accepted into University of British Columbia and graduated with Honours in Accounting.
      | For the past seven years, I pursued a career as a CPA accountant and eventually worked as a management consultant. 
      | Throughout my career, I have worked with organizations across all sectors, from local non-profits and local tech startups to
      | biopharmaceuticals and multinational mining corporations. I have worked with teams across Canada and on multinational projects in Mexico and Argentina.

      | A few years back, I was reflecting on my career and despite being grateful and had a great experience working with a wide variety of clients
      | and a group of high callibre individuals, I felt like I needed a new challenge. I wanted a career that allows me to create things and to solve problems.
      | During one of our food adventures, one of my closest friends who is a software developer posed the question 
      i " What about software development? " 
      | I thought to myself 
      i " I do not think I am smart enough to do that. " 
      | and rubbed it off.

      | At a company townhall meeting, we were introduced to a case study where NBA collaborated with KPMG US
      | to assess NBA teams' travel schedules to identify opportunities to reduce travel time. By harnessing data analytics
      | capabilities and optimization techniques, NBA successfully reshuffled their matches which helped reduced travel time significantly.
      | Being an avid football fan myself, it peaked my interest as I was extremely intrigued by how data analytics can play a role in 
      | potentially enhancing the beautiful game.

      | A few months later during my 2017 trip to South America, on a train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, a gentlemen sitting beside me was programming on his laptop and I decided to
      | strike a conversation with him. Three hours later, my interest in data anaytics was rekindled. During our exchanges, I began to realize that
      | in order to pursue data analytics, having a computer science background is key as it enables one to be proficient in utilizing various
      | programming languages and softwares to analyze data. Hence, I decided that attaining knowledge in computer science would be my first step in this
      | career transition. A few days later while in Medina, Colombia, I 
      | started exploring universities and eventually applied for Oregon State University the week I landed back in Vancouver. 
      | Within days, I received my acceptance letter and never looked back since. [To be continued...]

      | A new road or a secret gate,
      br
      | And though I oft have passed them by,
      br
      | A day will come at last when I,
