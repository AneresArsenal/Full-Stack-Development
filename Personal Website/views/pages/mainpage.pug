      | As the Swedes say it best, hej hej! Thank you for visiting my personal page. 
      | I created this website (see: work-in-progress) mainly for two reasons.
      | Firstly, as a personal diary, to reflect on my learning milestones in software engineering and data science.
      | Secondly, to share with you some of the fun things I am fiddling with at the moment (including building this website!). Enjoy!
