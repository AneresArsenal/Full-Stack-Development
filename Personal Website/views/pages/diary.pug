      | Building on from CS161, we dived further into the topic on data structures as well as 
      | programming techniques and application of software engineering principles. Using C++ as
      | well in this course, we learned to use classes, structures, inheritance and polymorphism
      | to create more efficient programs. We also learned to develop test-data sets and testing plan
      | to ensure our programs function as expected. This really helped me trained myself to think critically
      | about how my program functions and if it satisfy the objectives and criterias that are established
      | for the program.

    p.diary 
      | This is my first programming course I have taken. The language used for this course
      | was C++. The course provided an overview of fundamental concepts of computer science which
      | included the aspect of problem solving in computer science, software engineering
      | as well and object-oriented programming. We learned essential topics such as algorithm design, 
      | program development, recursive definitions and graph theory. It was what I would call
      | the perfect "initiation" into programming. Tough but essential, learning to deal with 
      | memory allocation and management as well as ensuring the right data types are used was helpful
      | in my training as a programmer. It has helped trained my mind to visualize the flow of data within 
      | the program to avoid memory leaks and ensuring appropriate usage of variables and data structures.

    p.diary 
      | This is the first course I took with OSU. CS325 covered the fundemental discrete mathematics of 
      | computer science which covered topics such as logic, set and set operations, methods of proof, 
      | recursive definitions and graph theory. Despite it not being a favourite amongst the students,
      | I personally enjoyed learning the logic and proofing methods as math has always been a favourite
      | subject of mine in academia. After progressing through the program, I realized that the logic topic
      | covered in this course has been tremendously helpful in training my mind to think a certain way
      | when creating for, while, do while loops as well as understanding recursions.
